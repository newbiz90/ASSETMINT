I suspect some of that was a sigh of relief that it wasn't hot and some was due to the m/m core unrounded at +0.261% compared to +0.3% expected. Now some of that might have been because of an upward revision to January to +0.5% from +0.4% but the market will take the help where it can get it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003ePowell himself struck me as incrementally more hawkish, though he did say that today's PCE report was \\\"pretty much in line with our expectations\\\" and \\\"good to see\\\". At the same time, he said the Fed wants to see more inflation reports like last year, which indicates it's not enough.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eWhat struck me was that he didn't highlight the opportunity to cut rates this year, though he wasn't really asked about it. In the longer term, he said that if inflation stays sticky for longer, they will hold for longer (importantly, he didn't say they would hike).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eIn any case, the early US dollar selling was slowly faded and we're winding down the day exactly where it began. Monday is also a holiday in parts of the world (Europe in particular) so we might not be back to full throttle in markets. Watch Asia though with the BOJ's Tankan and China's manufacturing PMI.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eHave a happy Easter.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n                This article was written by Adam Button at www.forexlive.com.\",\"url\":\"https://www.forexlive.com/news/forexlive-americas-fx-news-wrap-powell-says-pce-report-pretty-much-in-line-20240329/\"},{\"category\":\"forex\",\"datetime\":1711733400,\"headline\":\"Bitcoin Q2 Fundamental Forecast: Current Demand/Supply Imbalance is Driving Bitcoin Higher\",\"id\":7354150,\"image\":\"https://a.c-dn.net/b/2uHvkG/shutterstock_2142326215.jpg\",\"related\":\"\",\"source\":\"Dailyfx\",\"summary\":\"In this article, we delve into the fundamental outlook for Bitcoin, examining significant market catalysts that may shape the trajectory of cryptocurrencies in the second quarter.\",\"url\":\"https://www.dailyfx.com/news/bitcoin-q2-fundamental-forecast-current-demand-supply-imbalance-is-driving-bitcoin-higher-20240329.html\"},{\"category\":\"forex\",\"datetime\":1711708225,\"headline\":\"Equities Q2 Fundamental Outlook: AI Euphoria, US Election and the Fed to Drive US Stocks\",\"id\":7354084,\"image\":\"https://a.c-dn.net/b/4oxTpW/iStock-517963238.jpg\",\"related\":\"\",\"source\":\"Dailyfx\",\"summary\":\"US stocks enjoyed a broad rally in Q1 and the positive market sentiment looks likely to spill over into Q2.
